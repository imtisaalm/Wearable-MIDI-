A wearable MIDI controller that interacts with the Roland JD-Xi synthesiser. It allows the user to trigger chords and shape the resulting sound in real time using finger movements.

## Hardware Requirements
 
### Bill of Materials

The table below outlines the hardware components used in this project. Exact component matches are not required, and suitable alternatives will yield comparable results. However, as the software has been developed specifically for the Raspberry Pi, it is strongly recommended to retain this as the target platform.
 
| Component | Part Number | Quantity | Approx. Cost (unit)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Pi 5 4GB | 1 | £105.60 |
| Adafruit ADS1115 | 1085 | 1 | £11.18 |
| Adafruit TLC59711 | 1455 | 1 | £6.73 |
| Spectra Symbol Flex Sensor FLX| FLX-L-055-123-MP | 4 | £8.51 |
| Tactile Switch, 4.3mm | MCDTS2-1N| 4 | £0.17 |
| Kingbright L-7113IT 5mm 2V Red LED 80mcd | 56-0250 | 8 | £0.08 |
| Pisugar S Plus 5000 mAh Raspberry Pi UPS | Pisugar S Plus | 1 | £29.99 |

A MIDI-receiving device is required to complete the setup, either a hardware synthesiser or a software synthesiser running on a connected laptop. In this project, a Roland JD-Xi synthesiser was used, receiving MIDI directly from the Raspberry Pi over USB-B.

## Software Requirements

### Toolchain
Build system is CMake, but we provide a simple top-level Makefile to make things easy. Feel free to run the `cmake` commands manually if you are so inclined. The `install-deps.sh` script will automatically install dependencies required by DigitSynth. 

## Installing
A simple install can be performed using the `.deb` package in the latest release. Download `digitsynth-aarch64.deb`, then run ```bash sudo dpkg -i digitsynth-aarch64.deb``` in your terminal after navigating to the directory into which the archive was downloaded. The standalone binary can also be found in the release.  Note that dependencies still need to be installed. 

## Building

### 1.1 Clone the Repository
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RTES-Group/DigitSynth.git
cd DigitSynth
```

OR 

### 1.2 Download the release
Find the latest release on the right-hand side of this page. Download either the `.tar.gz` or `.zip`. After downloading and navigating to the download directory: 

#### `zip`
```bash 
unzip DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx.zip

cd DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx
```

#### `tar.gz`
```bash 
tar -xf DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz

cd DigitSynth-xx.xx.xx
```


### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Dependencies

| Library | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| IIR Filter Library | Digital IIR filter design and processing | [berndporr/iir1](https://github.com/berndporr/iir1) |
| RtMidi | Real-time MIDI input/output | [thestk/rtmidi](https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi) |
| ADS1115 API | Flex sensor measurement | [berndporr/rpi_ads1115](github.com/berndporr/rpi_ads1115) |
| libgpiod | GPIO management | [ligpiod](https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html) | 
| libasound2-dev | ALSA development headers | [libasound2-dev](https://alsa-project.org/) |

Simply run the `install-deps.sh` script:
```bash 
./install-deps.sh
```

### 3. Enable SPI and I2C on the Raspberry Pi:
SPI must be enabled before the project will run:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options → SPI → Enable
# Navigate to: Interface Options → I2C → Enable
```

### 4. Build the project:

```bash
cd application/
make
```

### 5. Run:
```bash
build/digitsynth
```
